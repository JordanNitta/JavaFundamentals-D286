<h6>Letâ€™s create a package and class structure for a product inventory application. You will create Product, Inventory, and Warehouse classes with a few fields and a Main class to test your implementation.</h6>

<ol>
    <li>Create a package named inventory.</li>
    <li>Inside the inventory package, create the following classes with the specified fields:</li>
    <li>Product:
        productId (int)
        productName (String)
        price (double)
    </li>
    <li>Inventory:
        product (Product)
        quantity (int)
    </li>
    <li>Warehouse:
        warehouseId (int)
        warehouseName (String)
        inventories (String, later we'll create an ArrayList of Inventory objects)
    </li>
    <li>
        Create a package named main
    </li>
    <li>
        Inside the main package, create a class named Main with a main method.
    </li>
    <li>
         Add the necessary imports to the Main class for the Product, Inventory, and Warehouse classes from the inventory package. They should go below the package statement:
    </li>
    <li>
         In the main method, create Product, Inventory, and Warehouse objects and set some values for their fields.
    </li>
    <li>
         Print all the values of the field to the console to verify your solution.
    </li>
</ol>
