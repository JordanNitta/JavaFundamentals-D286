Your company is holding a football tournament - your choice whether this is American Football or real football ;)

You are asked to create an application for it. After discussing this with your colleague, your assignment is to set up the first rough structure. You need to create the package and class structure for the football tournament application.

This application will have different classes to represent teams, players, matches, and the tournament itself.

For each class, add the necessary class members (only fields) according to the requirements described below:

- Team: name (String) and players (String (for now, later we’ll create an ArrayList of Player objects)
- Player: name (String), age (int), position (String), and team (Team object)
- Match: team1 (Team object), team2 (Team object), score1 (int), score2 (int), and winner (Team object)
- Tournament: name (String), teams (String for now, later we’ll create an ArrayList of Team objects), and matches (String for now, later we’ll use an ArrayList of Match objects)

Note: We won’t use more complicated concepts such as access modifiers and constructors, because these have not been covered yet.

Steps
If you need more guidance, follow the steps below to create this structure:

1. Create a package named footballtournament.

2. Inside the footballtournament package, create the following classes:

- Team
- Player
- Match
- Tournament

3. To each class, add the fields as described in the requirements.

Explanation:
This solution provides a package called footballtournament and four classes: Team, Player, Match, and Tournament. The classes have attributes that represent their real-life counterparts in a football tournament context.
